(1) TE annotation and selection
## NOTE: if RUN TIME is not explicitly stated, usually runs in under 2 minutes

## NOTE: These steps were performed for both Myotis myotis and Myotis lucifugus genome assemblies

	(1a) RepeatMask Reference Genome:
	## Need de novo genome assembly fasta file and TE sequence library
	## Myotis myotis genome taken from Genbank, Genbank Accession: GCA_014108235.1
	## Myotis lucifugus genome taken from Genbank, Genbank Accession: GCA_000147115.1
	## This was performed with RepeatMasker v4.0.7 using SGE-RepeatMasker batching
	## RUN TIME: About 8-10 hours (very approx. time; usually leave to run overnight)

	/lustre/work/daray/software/RepeatMasker-4.0.7_new/RepeatMasker -pa 20 -nolow -lib corrected_denovo_bat_library_1-7-2018.fas -xsmall -dir . -a -gff -inv myoLuc2.fa

	#Used SGE-RepeatMasker - see mLuc_rm.sh, mLuc2.sh

	## Run post-processing script
	## RUN TIME: About 2-3 hours

	sh RM_post.sh myoLuc2.fa.align

	#Use the select_size file (has only hits => 100 bases)

	## To convert to bed file:

	cat myoLuc2.fa.select_size.out | awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"}{if(NR>3) {if($9=="C"){strand="-"}else{strand="+"};print $5,$6-1,$7,$10,".",strand}}' > myoLuc2.fa.select_size.bed

	## Change cat to zcat and .out to .out.gz if done after RM_post.sh finishes running
	## or 

	awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"}{if(NR>3){if($9=="C"){strand="-"}else{strand="+"};print $5,$6-1,$7,$10,".",strand}}' < myoLucRM.fa.out > myoLucRM.fa.out.bed

	(1b) Estimate TE subfamily ages
	## Get counts of all TEs - can do this in Excel or via command line
	## Estimate TE subfamily ages using TE divergence and neutral mutation rate
	## This was done with RepeatMasker output filtered through RM2Bed.py, and lists of 8-10 TE subfamilies to plot using TE_landscape_mya_bins.py

	python TE_landscape_mya_bins.py -b mMyo_higher_score_rm.bed -g <Genome size in bp> -t myotis -sf <List of TE subfamilies file>

	(1c) Grep out desired TEs from genome.out.bed file to individual TE superfamily .bed files
	## E.g. grep hAT myoLuc2.fa.out.bed > hats.out.bed
	## Needs more than that because of overlapping/non-overlapping naming conventions
	## Remove any hits that start at site 0 on the contig (cause Java runtime error during MELT run); run MELT with the edited files
	## E.g. grep -v -w 0 allL1s.bed > allL1s_edited.bed
	## E.g. for NAME in $LIST; do grep -v -w 0 $NAME".out.bed" > /lustre/scratch/npaulat/MELTv2.1.5/references/beds/$NAME".out.bed"; done

	## NOTE: When pulling directly from RM output, "Ves" will include all Ves

	# Filter all hits that start at 0 from the .fa.out.bed (easier than removing from indiv TE files)
	## -v Excludes the search term; -w Only finds search term present as a complete word

	grep -v -w 0 myoLuc2.fa.select_size.bed > myoLuc_size_filtered.unsorted.bed

	module load intel bedtools

	bedtools sort -i myoLuc2_size_filtered.unsorted.bed > myoLuc_size_filtered.bed

	# Then split out all individual TE subfamilies of interest
